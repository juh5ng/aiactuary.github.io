# Introduction

## Who is Donald Trump?

Donald John Trump (born June 14, 1946) is an American media personality, businessman, and politician who served as the 45th president of the United States from 2017 to 2021.
born and raised in Queens, New York City, Trump graduated from the University of Pennsylvania with a bachelor's degree in 1968. He became the president of his father Fred Trump's real estate business in 1971 and renamed it The Trump Organization. Trump expanded the company's operations to building and renovating skyscrapers, hotels, casinos, and golf courses. He later started various side ventures, mostly by licensing his name. Trump and his businesses have been involved in more than 4,000 state and federal legal actions, including six bankruptcies. He owned the Miss Universe brand of beauty pageants from 1996 to 2015. From 2003 to 2015, he co-produced and hosted the reality television series The Apprentice. Trump's political positions have been described as populist, protectionist, isolationist, and nationalist. He entered the 2016 presidential race as a Republican and was elected in an upset victory over Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton while losing the popular vote,[a] becoming the first U.S. president without prior military or government service. His election and policies sparked numerous protests. Trump made many false and misleading statements during his campaigns and presidency, to a degree unprecedented in American politics. Many of his comments and actions have been characterized as racially charged or racist. He has a history of insulting and belittling women.

## How did I think of him before reading this book?

To be honest, I thought he was an arrogant and mad person, and people in america chosed a wrong president. I could not understand his behaviors and decisions. However, after I read this book, I could understand why he did those kind of somewhat called "aggresive" speakings and behaviors. It was originated from his dealing strategy. He enjoyed dealing, and during his entire life, he could get the know-hows for make higher performance on the dealing. One of his dealing strategy is a strong stands from the begining to the very end. While I've been reading this book and reminded of what I had saw on his news, I finally get to know the inside voice in his thinking. 
>The later you compromise, the more you get. And before you compromise, keep in strong and firm stands. Then you'll get optimized earnings.

## Chapter 1. Deal is an art

The first Chapter on [Trump - the art of the deal], he describes on his daily routines for 5 days(Monday to Friday). He keeps calling somewhere and deals with various decisions in a short term. He is confident with his opinions and he has many business partners (lawyers, accountants, bankers, architectures, artists, ... etc.). As a businessman he works hard on daily routine, and the business decisions make him richer on and on. What I was suprised of was that he was very intuitive and wasn't buried over the numbers or the decent reports. While a lot of opportunities and callings to start a new business come to him, he could catch "real" business opportunities.

I'd like to introduce his insights from a successful escaping on a financial risk.

> 1. Be devoted to your own decisions.
> 2. Using what you already know is much easier to make money. Using what you rarely know is much harder to make money.
> 3. Sometimes "not investing" on something might be the best investment strategy. - because you can save your money from losing it.
